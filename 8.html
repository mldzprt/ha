Hot Cheese Puffs </span> Food Reviews <h3> Nostalgia Snacks Co. Hot Cheese Puffs </h3> <span> reviewed by Kris Caballero <span> -</span> <span> Aug 18, 2020 </span> </span> comment(s) <h3> Nostalgia Snacks Co. Hot Cheese Puffs Review</h3> <p> Yeah, "stay home" is the slogan/phrase going into this year. Who would've thought that even if we want to "win big," our only option left is to stay home? At least this has given a lot of people a chance to binge video gaming, reading, watching TV, watching movies. In response to the current situation I'm currently resided in southern Califonia (Los Angeles) here's a treat you may want to check out.<br> <br> I want to say props to the designer of the bag as it brings this old carnival feel to it; Walking around the park and basking in the rides, vendors, people walking by, the noise and the overall atmosphere, while snacking on a strip-colored box of popcorn. Although <b> Nostalgia Snacks Co.</b> does sell popcorn, we're looking at these cheese puffs <i> hot</i> cheese puffs. You'd think nothing of it, given that the puffs are mostly orange and cheesy, but surely the taste will prove otherwise.<br> <br> Although not as egregiously spicy as thought, the level of heat has this sharp taste to it. You ever sampled the difference between cheddar cheese and <i> sharp</i> cheddar cheese? The same could be said for the "hot-ness" of these puffs. Other spicy, hot chips often hit your taste buds then its heat "blossoms" slowly as you eat more. The heat on these puffs sort of feels like that razor blade used to shave your facial hair: Sharp but a nice feeling. I wouldn't say it's crazy hot to the point where your eyes will water, unless you're the type who never eats spicy foods, but it's enough to give your taste buds a kick. That kickin' feeling will surely wake you up, but the cheddar flavors will accompany the heat, making it hard to resist.<br> <br> This is certainly one of those snacks where eating one or two pieces isn't enough, and by the time you've satisfied your cravings, you've finished the entire bag. The quality of the crunch is fresh, and is the perfect snack to munch while binge-watching your favorite movies. Oh, and I forgot to mention, the puffs are light and won't make you feel 'heavy' after eating a certain amount of pieces. Yeah, it could get addicting too.<br> <br> All in all, this humble brand of puffs deserves a taste. There's no shame in admitting that you finished an entire bag, because the pieces are light and crunchy. You're not bothering anyone anyway, so satisfy your cravings how ever you so choose, and in this case, this amazing snack will punch in that ticket for you!<br> <br> </p> <B> <I> &copy; 2008-2020 written and reviewed personally by Kris Caballero.</I> </B> <BR> <h3> Nostalgia Snacks Co.
